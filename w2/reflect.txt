1.  
  (a) 
    a = 4
    a = 3
  (b) 
    First Snippet:
    a is incremented by 1 before the printf function is called.
    Second Snippet:
    printf function prints the value of a before the increment.
2.
  Because float has only a precision of about 6-7 decimal digits. 
  It can't always accurately represent certain decimal values due to its limited precision.
  Therefore when those values are manipulated easily leading to errors (price 1).
  But sometimes it happens to be accurately represented (price 3).
3.
  First: $0.00 -> No implicit conversion. The format specifier %.2lf expects a double, but an int is provided, leading to a type mismatch problem.
  Second: $20 ->  No type coercion. The types match correctly.
  Third: $20.31 -> Arithmetic Promotion, explicitly casts from int to double.
  Forth: $0 -> Arithmetic Promotion, explicitly casts from int to double. However, the format specifier %d expects an int type, but a double is provided, leading to a type mismatch problem.
