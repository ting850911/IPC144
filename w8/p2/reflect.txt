1. In this workshop, you have the “convertLbsKg” function. This function returns one value in two different ways. 
Explain how each return method works. 
  Return by Value:
  The function returns the value of the calculation of the weight in kilograms.
  Return by Reference:
  The function assigns the value of the calculation of the weight in kilograms to the variable that is passed by reference.
If we wanted to revise this function so it doesn’t provide two ways to return a value, and instead, break this out into two separate functions, what would each function prototype look like?
  double convertLbsToKg(const double *lbs);
  bool convertLbsToKgPtr(const double *lbs, double *kg);

2. Name a few functions in this workshop where they are highly cohesive and loosely coupled and explain why.
  Highly cohesive functions:	getCatFoodInfo, displayCatFoodHeader, displayCatFoodData, calculateReportData, displayReportHeader, displayReportData, displayFinalAnalysis
  They are all related to the same task of processing and displaying cat food data.
  Loosely coupled functions:	start	
  It calls other functions to perform specific tasks, but it does not rely on the internal implementation of those functions.

3. You used a header (.h) file for the first time in this workshop. The header file also had a source code file (.c) to complement it where the function definitions were placed. 
What are your thoughts on using this design and approach to manage the development of the application? 
  I think using a header file and a source code file is a good approach to managing the development of the application.
Provide specific references to the workshop to help you communicate your remarks.
  Because it helps to separate the function prototypes from the function implementations.
