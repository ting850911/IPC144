1. I used to work as a frontend engineer, so I mainly wrote JavaScript. 
  However, when I first started learning programming, I used Java, 
  so I find C quite similar to Java, except for the differences in call by reference and pointers.

2. The compiling process of turning a C text file into an executable program involves 
  the use of a compiler to translate the higher-level C code into machine language (0 and 1), 
  which can then be executed directly by the computer.

3. In this course, I hope to gain a deeper understanding of backend operations. 
  I don't wanna restrict myself to just front-end development.
  Although I have experience with Java, it's been a while since I've used it,
  so starting from the beginning will also serve as a good refresher.
